# Blog Application
## Overview
This is a blog application built using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It leverages DBeaver for efficient database management. A key component of this application is the utilization of the Outlet in React Router DOM to render child routes and display nested content on the frontend.

## Features
- PERN Stack: Utilizes PostgreSQL for the database, Express.js for the server, React.js for the frontend, and Node.js for server-side execution.
* DBeaver: Employed for database management, providing an intuitive interface to interact with PostgreSQL.
+ Nested Routing: Implements nested routing using Outlet from React Router DOM to handle complex route structures and nested content rendering.

## Key Components
### Backend
- Express.js: Manages API endpoints and server-side logic.
* PostgreSQL: Database system for storing blog-related data.
+ Node.js: Executes the server-side code and handles requests.

### Frontend
- React.js: Renders the user interface and handles client-side logic.
* React Router DOM: Manages routing with the Outlet component to support nested routes and content.
+ Database Management
- DBeaver: A robust database management tool used for setting up and managing the PostgreSQL database, providing a user-friendly interface for database operations.

## Conclusion
This blog application demonstrates the effective use of the PERN stack for full-stack development. By integrating DBeaver for database management and utilizing React Router DOMâ€™s Outlet component, it provides a robust solution for creating, managing, and displaying blog content with nested routing capabilities.
